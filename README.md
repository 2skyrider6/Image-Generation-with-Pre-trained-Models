# Image Generation with Pre-trained Models

Welcome to the Image Generation with Pre-trained Models project! This repository contains code and resources for generating images using various pre-trained deep learning models. These models are trained on large datasets and can produce high-quality, realistic images based on different input parameters.

## Introduction

Image generation is a fascinating area of artificial intelligence that allows for the creation of novel images from scratch. This project leverages pre-trained models, such as GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), VAEs (Variational Autoencoders), and other state-of-the-art architectures, to generate images with minimal effort.

## Features

- Easy-to-use interface for generating images.
- Supports multiple pre-trained models.
- Customizable parameters for image generation.
- Examples and tutorials to get started quickly.
- Extensible codebase for adding new models and features.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-generation-with-pretrained-models.git
cd image-generation-with-pretrained-models
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After installing the dependencies, you can start generating images using the provided scripts. Here is a basic example:

```bash
python generate_image.py --model gan --input noise_vector.npy --output generated_image.png
```

### Command-line Arguments

- `--model`: The pre-trained model to use (e.g., gan, vae).
- `--input`: Path to the input file (e.g., noise vector, latent vector).
- `--output`: Path to save the generated image.

## Models

This project currently supports the following pre-trained models:

- **GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)**: Generates realistic images from random noise.
- **VAE (Variational Autoencoder)**: Produces images by encoding and decoding latent vectors.
- **Other models**: Additional models will be added in future updates.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of generated images using different models:
